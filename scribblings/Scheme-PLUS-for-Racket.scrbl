Scheme+ is an extension of the syntax of the Scheme language.

Scheme+ adds to Scheme a way to use also infix notation with a compatibility near 100% and not as a sub-system of Lisp syntax as it is often done but with a complete integration in the Scheme reader/parser system and also for Racket at REPL (Read Eval Print Loop).

Scheme+ is to Scheme what a concept-car is to automobile.Scheme+ is a concept-language.It is ideally what should be a modern Scheme.
As Scheme+ syntax is compatible with Scheme syntax you can mix the two syntaxes in the same program. 

Scheme+ makes it easy the assignment of Scheme objects in infix (works also in prefix) notation with a few new operators <- (or: ← , :=),⥆ (or <+) for definitions.

Scheme+ makes it easy the access and assignment for arrays,strings,hash tables,etc by allowing the classic square brackets [ ] of other languages.

What Scheme+ is not: Scheme+ is not a DSL (Domain Specific Language) a contrario Scheme+ tends to be the more universal possible and to be applied in a lot of domains.

@table-of-contents[]

@section[#:tag "both"]{Both prefix and infix expressions in the same world}

You can mix infix sub-expressions and prefix sub-expressions in the same expression:
@codeblock|{
{(3 + 1) * (2 * (+ 2 1) - (sin 0.3)) + ((* 2 5) - 5)}
27.817919173354642
}|

The above expression is automatically parsed and converted in a classic scheme prefix expression before evaluation:
@codeblock|{
(+
 (*
   (+ 3 1)
   (- (* 2 (+ 2 1)) (sin 0.3)))
  (- (* 2 5) 5))
}|

Other examples:

@codeblock|{
(define (fib n)
  (if {n < 2}
      n
      {(fib (n - 1)) + (fib (n - 2))} ))

(fib 7)
13
}|


@codeblock|{
{(- 7 (3 * (+ 2 4) - 1)) + 3}
-7
}|

The parsing is the result of sometimes up to 3 stages of parsing:
@itemlist[#:style'ordered
          @item{SRFI 105 Curly Infix is an external parser necessary for the curly brackets { } syntax which is not in the base of scheme language.}
          @item{Syntax transformers are sometimes used at a "compile" stage before the code run.}
	  @item{Parsing at runtime is rarely done but can be necessary when the parsed expression or some of her subexpressions remain ambiguous at prior parsing stages about being infix or prefix expressions.}]

Here the parsing process is activated by the encountering of curly parenthesis { } in the expressions (there exist also other ways to force the parsing):

@codeblock|{
(define (line-length x0 y0 x1 y1)
  (√ {(x1 - x0) ² + (y1 - y0) ²}))

{(ksy / (√ 2)) * ((- x) + y)}

(define (norm x y)
  {x ² + y ²})
}|

@section[#:tag "installation"]{Scheme+ Installation and Depandencies}

Scheme+ can be installed via the Racket Package system or downloaded from Github.See the links at the top of this page.
Scheme+ is designed to be used with the package SRFI-105 for Racket which is a curly infix reader also available in the same way described above.


@section[#:tag "REPL"]{Scheme+ and Curly Infix SRFI-105 REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)}

As Scheme+ is designed to be used with the Curly infix syntax of SRFI-105, the latter one requires an external reader/parser and a specific REPL (Read Eval Print Loop).
The REPL must be loaded in Racket GUI or invoked in the shell if you work in command line mode.
The REPL file can be found in the source code of Scheme+ or SRFI-105 in the @bold{src/} sub-directory, his name is @bold{REPL-Scheme-PLUS.rkt}.

Here is the source code of @bold{REPL-Scheme-PLUS.rkt} which is also a typical example of how to write a simple Scheme+ module or program:
@codeblock|{
#! /usr/bin/env -S racket --load REPL-Scheme-PLUS.rkt --repl
;; the line above is not mandatory,only for launching a script in command line
;; in CLI you must (require Scheme+) manually
;; but if you want to have syntax color in CLI start racket yourself and do:
;; (load "REPL-Scheme-PLUS.rkt")

#lang reader SRFI-105 ; SRFI-105 Curly-infix-expressions

(module repl racket

  (provide (all-defined-out)) 
  (require Scheme+)
  
  ;; put your code here or simply use the REPL

  )
}|


@section[#:tag "hello"]{A simple Hello World application in Scheme+ and Curly Infix}

@codeblock|{
#lang reader SRFI-105 ; SRFI-105 Curly-infix-expressions

(module hello-world racket

  (provide (all-defined-out)) 
  (require Scheme+)
  
  (display "Hello world") (newline)

  )
}|

note it seems in the latest version of Racket we can replace the first line simply by :
@codeblock|{
#reader SRFI-105
(provide (all-defined-out)) 
(require Scheme+)
(display "Hello world") (newline)
}|

@section[#:tag "syntax"]{Scheme+ Syntax and Conventions}

@subsection[#:tag "curly"]{Curly Infix notation with { }}

In general Scheme+ use the same convention for infix expression than SRFI-105 Curly Infix that is an infix expression is between curly parenthesis { }.
But infix sub-expressions are allowed to be between normal parenthesis ( ) like it is in mathematic notation. Infix or prefix is then autodetected.In case of ambiguities { } force infix mode. Inside curly infix expression surrounded by { } parenthesis associativity and operator precedence are applied.

@codeblock|{
#reader SRFI-105
(require Scheme+)
> {3 * 5 + 2} ; the displayed symbol > is here only the Racket prompt
(+ (* 3 5) 2) ; generated code displayed by REPL/parser
17 ; result
}|

@codeblock|{
{3 * 7 + 2 - 12 / 3 + -2}
17
}|

In the examples the display of the REPL/parser in prefix will generally be removed from examples for clarity, also the prompt > and the displayed #<eof> (end of file) printed by the SRFI-105 parser.

@codeblock|{
#lang reader SRFI-105
(require Scheme+)
{3 · 5 + 2 ³}
23
}|

Note that in the above example and in Scheme+ the operator @racket[·] is @racket[*], also note that superscript chars are exposants.

In the following sections i will omit to rewrite the directives about lang or reader and the requirement in each example to keep the code and the web page compact.

An example of inner round brackets inside curly brackets in a full infix expression:

@codeblock|{
(define x {3 * (2 + 4) - 1})
(display x)
17
}|

Example of a mixed infix and prefix expression autodetected:

@codeblock|{
{3 * (+ 2 4) - 1}
17
}|

Other examples:

@codeblock|{
(define (fib n)
  (if {n < 2}
      n
      {(fib (n - 1)) + (fib (n - 2))} ))

(fib 7)
13
}|

@codeblock|{
{3 ² + 2 · 3 · 5 + 5 ²}
64
}|


@subsection[#:tag "square"]{Square Bracket notation with [ ]}

The square bracket notation can be used with any object that can be indexed or retrieved by a key: it works with vectors,strings of characters, arrays, hash tables,etc.


@defform[#:id \[\] {T[k]}]{
Return value of vector or in general object T indexed by k.
}

@codeblock|{
{#(1 2 3 4)[2]} 
($bracket-apply$ #(1 2 3 4) 2) ; code generated by the parser
3

}|

I will not always display generated code by parser and end of file symbol as only the result is important for the programmer.

@codeblock|{
{#(1 2 3 4)[1]}
2
}|

@codeblock|{
(define T (vector 1 2 3 4 5))
{T[3]}
4
}|

@codeblock|{
{"hello"[4]}
#\o
}|


Negative index, that start from the end of object, can be used as in the Python language:
@codeblock|{
{"hello"[-4]}
#\e
}|


A slice notation with @bold{:} is available.It allows the same features as the slicing of Python language and sometimes more.


@defform[#:id \: {T[begin : end]}]{
Slicing of vectors or strings.
}

@codeblock|{
{"elephant"[2 : 5]}
"eph"
}|

@codeblock|{
{#(1 2 3 4 5)[2 :]}
'#(3 4 5)	
}|

@codeblock|{
{#(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)[2 * 5 - 8 : 3 * 5 - 10]}
'#(3 4 5)
}|

@codeblock|{
(define a 0)
(define b 5)
{"hello world"[a : b]}
"hello"
}|


@defform[#:link-target? #f  #:id \: {T[begin : end : step]}]{
@racket[begin], @racket[end], @racket[step]  are optional, see the Python language documentation for informations and use.
}

@codeblock|{
{#(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)[3 : 8 : 2]}
'#(4 6 8)
}|

@codeblock|{
{#(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)[-1 : 5 : -1]}
'#(9 8 7)
}|

@codeblock|{
{#(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)[: : 3]}
'#(1 4 7)
}|

@codeblock|{
{#(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)[: : -2]}
'#(8 6 4 2)
}|

@codeblock|{
{"abcdefghijklmno"[3 : : 2]}
"dfhjln"
}|

The square bracket notation [ ] works also with multiple dimensions vectors:

@codeblock|{
{M <- #(#(1 2 3)
        #(4 5 6))}
{M[1][2]}
6
}|

You can use also this [ ] notation variant, like matrix notation, and compatible with arrays in case of you use them:

@codeblock|{
{M <- #(#(1 2 3)
        #(4 5 6))}
{M[1 2]}
6
}|

Examples:

@codeblock|{
{ᐁ[i][k] <- y[k] - z[i][k]}
}|

@subsection[#:tag "file_naming"]{File naming conventions}
Generally a Scheme+ program file is named with a + symbol before the normal scheme extension, examples: SssDyna+.scm or SssDyna+.rkt.The Makefile (see section more below) i provide will automatically parse files named with this convention.

@section[#:tag "reference"]{Scheme+ Reference}


@subsection[#:tag "declarations"]{Declarations}

@defform[(declare name1 name2 ...)]{
Declare new variables named @racket[name1],@racket[name2],....
}

@codeblock|{
(declare x)
(when (identifier-binding #'x)
    "variable x exists")
"variable x exists"
}|

You can not both declare and define a variable in a program (module):

@codeblock|{
#reader SRFI-105
(provide (all-defined-out)) 
(require Scheme+)
(declare x)
(define x 3)
}|

@elem[#:style (style #f (list (color-property "red")))]{module: identifier already defined in: x}

Note that @racket[declare] is rarely used,instead assignment macros like @racket[<-] are used, but it could be usefull in case a variable used in a block must be used outside the scope of the block too like in this example:

@codeblock|{
(declare x)
{t <- 3}
(when {t > 1}
  {x <- 7})
{x <- x + 1}
x

8 ; result
}|



By default the declared variables are set to @bold{NIL}, that is @bold{'()}

@codeblock|{
(declare x)
x
'()
}|

@subsection[#:tag "definitions"]{Definitions}


@defform[#:link-target? #f #:id <+ {name <+ value}]{
Define new variable @racket[name] and assign value @racket[value].
Mnemonic of <+ is to @italic{add} a new variable in the environment.
}

@codeblock|{
{x <+ 7}
x
7
}|

Note: this is almost never used in Racket,because Scheme+ for Racket has a special feature of @bold{autodetecting} if a variable needs to be defined before assignment and in this case it will @racket[define] it for the programmer in the current block.

There is some alias of @racket[<+] :

@defform[#:id ⥆ {name ⥆ value}]{}

Note: a lot of operators of Scheme+ that works left to right exist in the opposite sense, i will not document them as it is obvious,example:

@defform[#:link-target? #f #:id ⥅ {value ⥅ name}]{}

Also a lot of Scheme+ operator have infix n-arity capability , i will not completely document them at the beginning of this document but in other parts later.

@codeblock|{
{name ⥆ name2 ⥆ 7}
(list name name2)
'(7 7)
}|

@subsection[#:tag "assignment"]{Assignments}


@defform[#:link-target? #f #:id <- {name <- value}]{
Assign to the variable @racket[name] the value @racket[value].
}

@codeblock|{
{x <- 7}
x
7
}|

If the variable was not existing in the current environment it will be automatically declared,this is a special feature of the Scheme+ version for Racket that can rarely be reproduced in other scheme implementations.

There is some alias of @racket[<-] :

@defform[#:link-target? #f #:id := {name := value}]{}

@codeblock|{
{index := index + 1}
}|


@defform[#:id ← {name ← value}]{}

@codeblock|{
{z ← 1.13+1.765i}
}|

@defform[#:id << {(name1 name2 ...) <- values}]{
You can also use the assignment or definition operators for creating tuples (like in Python) of values.
}

@codeblock|{
{(x y z) <- (values 1 2 3)}
(list x y z)
'(1 2 3)
}|



The assignment operator is a macro that works in taking in account the square bracket [ ] notation in the RHS (right hand side) of any expression:

@codeblock|{
(define T (make-vector 5))
{T[3] <- 7}
{T[3]}
7
}|

Remember @racket[:=],for Pascal language fans, is exactly the same as @racket[<-].

@codeblock|{
(require srfi/25)
{a := (make-array (shape 0 5 0 3) 0)}
{a[1 2] := 7}
{a[1 2]}
7
}|

Other example:

@codeblock|{
{M_i_o[j (i + 1)]  <-  M_i_o[j (i + 1)] + η · z_input[i] · მzⳆმz̃(z_output[j] z̃_output[j]) · ᐁ_i_o[j]}
}|

Note in the example above the special neoteric expression available by SRFI-105 Curly Infix: @bold{მzⳆმz̃(z_output[j] z̃_output[j])} which is automatically parsed and transformed in the prefix expression : @racket[(მzⳆმz̃ z_output[j] z̃_output[j])], note also that @racket[მzⳆმz̃] is only a symbol.

Assignment and slicing works as in Python language or even better,allowing more possibilities.

Examples:

@codeblock|{
{v <+ (vector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)}
'#(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
{v[: : 2] <- (vector -1 -2 -3 -4 -5)}
v
'#(-1 2 -2 4 -3 6 -4 8 -5)
}|

Note: remember @racket[<+] is for new definitions but in Racket i could have directly use @racket[<-].

@codeblock|{
{v <+ (vector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)}
{v[: : -2] := (vector -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 -11 -12 -13)[: : 2]}
v
'#(-9 2 -7 4 -5 6 -3 8 -1)
}|

Remember @racket[:=] is exactly the same as @racket[<-].

@codeblock|{
{v <+ (vector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)}
{v[: : -2] <- "abcdefghijklmnop"[: : 2]}
v
'#(#\i 2 #\g 4 #\e 6 #\c 8 #\a)
}|

@codeblock|{
{v <+ (vector 1 2 3 4)}
{v[1 : 3] <- "abcdef"[2 : 4]}
v
'#(1 #\c #\d 4)
}|

@codeblock|{
{v <+ (vector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)}
{v[3 : : 2] := (vector -1 -2 -3)}
v
'#(1 2 3 -1 5 -2 7 -3)
}|

@codeblock|{
{v <+ (vector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)}
{v[5 : : -2] <- (vector -1 -2 -3)}
v
'#(1 -3 3 -2 5 -1 7 8)
}|

@codeblock|{
{v <- (vector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)}
{v[7 : 2 : -2] <- (vector -1 -2 -3)}
v
'#(1 2 3 -3 5 -2 7 -1 9)
}|



@subsection[#:tag "define"]{Procedure definitions}

@defform[(def (name args ...) body ...+)]{
Define a procedure (also named function).
This does the same as the classic @racket[define] but allows the program to @racket[return] from the body of definitions at any moment.
This works the same as in other languages such as C or Python languages.
}

@defform[(return value ...)]{
Return immediately from the executing procedure defined with @racket[def] and return the values: @racket[value ...] . 
As the ellipsis indicate it, you can return multiple values.
}

Example:

@codeblock|{
(def (foo L)
   (when (null? L)
      (return "empty list"))
   (cons "hello list :" L))

(foo '())
"empty list"
}|

Note: @racket[return] can only be used inside specific macros :

	 
@codeblock|{
(return 7)
}|
@elem[#:style (style #f (list (color-property "red")))]{return: can only be used inside def,def+ and lambda+}

Another example:

@codeblock|{
;; this procedure check that we have a canonical infix expression
;; i call 'canonical' an expression such as 3 * 5 + 2
;; in contrary an equivalent expression such as this one: - - 3 * 5 + 2 is not 'canonical',etc

(def (infix-canonical? L)

	  (define lgt (length L))
	  (when (or (< lgt 3)

	    (return #f))
	    
	  (def (check-operators? L2)
	    (when (null? L2)
	      (return #t))
	    (if (not (operator-syntax? (car L2)))
		#f
		(check-operators? (cddr L2))))
		
	  (check-operators? (cdr L)))

(infix-canonical? '(2 * 3 4))
#f

(infix-canonical? '(2 * 3 + 4))
#t
}|

@defform[(return-rec value ...)]{

Note that scheme @racket[cond] and scheme+ @racket[condx] are a style of programming, you can use other style with same result, i think of using @racket[def] and @racket[return] with @racket[when] and @racket[if] that can replace them.


Example from real code of the subset sum problem from the file SssRec+.rkt in examples directory :

@codeblock|{
{c <- (first L)}
{R <- (rest L)}
(condx [ {c = t} (return #t
	       		 (cons c s)) ] ;; c is the solution
	      
       [ {c > t} (ssigma-solution-exact R t s) ] ;; c is to big to be a solution
	      
       ;; c < t at this point
       ;; c is part of the solution	 
       [ exec {(c-sol sol) <- (ssigma-solution-exact R (t - c) s)} ]
	      
       [ c-sol (return c-sol
		       (append (cons c s) ; c is in the solution for t, we insert it in the previous partial solution
			       sol)) ] ; we append with sol to get also the solutions of t - c,resulting in solutions of c + (t - c) = t

       ;; or c is not part of solution
       ;; or the two ! perheaps there exists 2 solutions using or not using c ! (in this case we got only the first found!)
       [ else
	  (ssigma-solution-exact R t s) ] )
}|

Note about the example above which mix @racket[condx] and @racket[return] because it is part of a procedure not displayed here, i encourage the reader to see the full source code SssRec+.rkt to understand it better.

@defform[#:literals (until) (repeat body ... until test)]{Like in Pascal or Lua: loop over @racket[body ...] until @racket[test] is true.}

@codeblock|{

     (newline)
     {i := i - 1}
   until {i < 0})

5

Note: above i used @racket[:=] which is exactly the same as @racket[<-] or @racket[←].

@defform[(while test  body ...)]{Initially the syntax should be as @racket[while] ... @racket[do] from Pascal but not possible as @racket[do] already exist in scheme.}

@defform[(for (initialization condition updation) body ...)]{Syntax of @racket[for] ... as it exists in C/C++,Javascript,Java language.}

@codeblock|{
(for ({i := 0} {i < 3} {i := i + 1})
    (display i)
    (newline))
0
1
2
}|

Other examples:
@codeblock|{
(for ({i <- 0} {i < n - 2} {i <- i + 1}) 
    ;; create an array with 1 in front for the bias coefficient
    {z_1 <- #(1) + z[i]} ; + operator has been overloaded to append scheme vectors
    {z̃[i + 1] <- M[i] · z_1} ; z̃ = matrix * vector , return a vector
    {z[i + 1] <- vector-map(activation_function_hidden_layer z̃[i + 1])})
}|

Example from matrix multiplication, compute element i,j of result:

@codeblock|{
(for ({k <- 0} {k < p1} {k <- k + 1})
    {sum <- sum + M1[i][k] * M2[k][j]})
}|

Note about Scheme+ for Racket: the @racket[for] described above replace the original @racket[for] of Racket, you should back up it as below before using that. Also Scheme+ define @racket[in-range] and @racket[reversed] as in Python language but they already exist in Racket Scheme.

@codeblock|{
(require (only-in racket/base [for for-racket])) ;; backup original Racket 'for'
(for-racket ([i (reverse (range 1 i_output_layer))])
				{nc <- vector-length(z[i])}
				{ns <- vector-length(z[i + 1])}
				(for-racket ([j (range nc)])
					{ᐁ[i][j] <- (for/sum ([k (range ns)])
							     (მzⳆმz̃(z[i + 1][k] z̃[i + 1][k]) · M[i][k (j + 1)] · ᐁ[i + 1][k]))})
				; modification des poids de la matrice de transition de la couche i-1 à i
         			{modification_des_poids(M[i - 1] ηₛ  z[i - 1] z[i] z̃[i] ᐁ[i] მzⳆმz̃)})
}|

}

@defform[($+> body ...)]{@racket[$+>] will allow also definitions in the @racket[body], the @racket[+] means you can add definitions in the environment.It is defined this way:
@codeblock|{

    ((_ ev ...) (let () ev ...))))

;; a <=> b ----> (a => b) and (b => a)
(define (elim-equivalence expr)
  (cond
   ((symbol? expr) expr)

Note: some Qi operators not documented here (see Qi documentation for them) are recognized, for example @racket[~>] should immediately work in infix.

@subsection[#:tag "superscript"]{Superscript}
Superscript characters can be used to form numbers, variable or expressions forming an exponent,thus defining an exponentiation without the need of @racket[**] operator:
@codeblock|{
{2 ³}
(** 2 3) ; parsed expression displayed
8
}|

@codeblock|{
(define n 3)
{3 ⁻²·⁽ⁿ⁻⁴⁾}
9
}|

Note that alphabetic superscript characters and numeric superscript characters can display at different level of altitude in the browser font system, this is not the case in Emacs editor.
Note also that not all alphabetic characters currently exists in superscript, here is the source code definitions:

@codeblock|{
(define superscript-string "⁻⁺⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹") ; super script numbers and signs
(define superscript-only-string (string-append superscript-string ; numbers and signs
					  "ᴬᵃᴮᵇᶜᴰᵈᴱᵉᶠᴳᵍᴴʰᴵᶦᴶʲᴷᵏᴸˡᴹᵐᴺⁿᴼᵒᴾᵖᴿʳˢᵀᵗᵁᵘⱽᵛᵂʷˣʸᶻ" ; note all letters are not available (ex:C,Q,q...)
					  "⁽⁾"
					  "⸱" ; will be used as decimal separator
					  ;; "*" ; multiplication is ambiguous (both super and normal script)
					  ;; "·" ; another multiplication symbol (but ambiguous too)
					  "⸍"; division
					  ))
}|

Note under Linux and on a PC (french) keyboard superscript characters can be generated with the keystroke sequence: ^ n where n is  a number or sign.(but this not works for alpha char as it only put some accent on the alpha char)

Superscript also works to write complex numbers exponents:

@codeblock|{
{3 ⁻²⁺³ᶦ}
(** 3 (+ (- 2) 0+3i)) ; code generated by parser
-0.10979199190468787-0.01707036982454185i
}|

Note that unfortunately for superscript complex number the lower case superscript @racket[i] does not exist and @racket[I] is not really a mathematical convention for complex number but you can use the true electrical convention that use the symbol @racket[j]:

@codeblock|{
{2 ⁻⁵⁺⁷ʲ}
(** 2 (+ (- 5) 0+7i)) ; code generated by parser
0.004349621840375144-0.03094581215359732i
}|

A last example:
@codeblock|{
{2-3i ⁻⁵⁺⁷ʲ}
(** 2-3i (+ (- 5) 0+7i)) ; code generated by parser
0.38835198150723493+1.5475077026949722i
}|

@subsection[#:tag "overload"]{Overloading procedures and operators}

Overloading must be set at a module toplevel, it will not works in a procedure,and there is no need of that.
You can @racket[provide] an overloaded procedure or operator from the module where it is defined and overloaded to other modules.

Different macros and procedures are provided for overloading because of the various type of operator or procedure, operator can be only binary or be n-arity,operators have associativity properties that do not have procedures.Also operators or procedure can preexist in Scheme or you can overload one of your new procedure or operator.All that requires different macros and procedures for overloading that can not be fusioned in a generic macro.

Overloading of operator or procedure is made in two steps:
@itemlist[#:style'ordered
          @item{first we define that a procedure or operator will be overloaded, this will result in creating a new procedure or operator that will be specialized in the next step.}
	  @item{second we overload a procedure or operator by providing a specialized function and some predicates that will be used to test the arguments at runtime.}]

With this schema we can have a same function (procedure or operator) that will works on different arguments.

Note that we can also extend square bracket [ ] to use different type of object, the same way it is done in the Python language for the angle bracket.This is done by overloading the underlaying procedure that do the bracket apply and the assignment macros,we will see that at the end of this section.

@defform[(define-overload-procedure name)]{Define an overloaded procedure named @racket[name].}

@codeblock|{
(define-overload-procedure area)
}|

@defform[(overload-procedure name special (predicate ...))]{Overload a procedure named @racket[name] with a specialized procedure named @racket[special] which use parameters that pass the @racket[predicates] test.}

@codeblock|{
(define (area-square x) (* x x))
(overload-procedure area area-square (number?))

(define (area-rect x y) (* x y))
(overload-procedure area area-rect (number? number?))

(area 3)
9

(area 2 3)
6
}|

Another example:

@codeblock|{
(define-overload-procedure uniform)
;; return a number in ]-1,1[
;; the dummy parameter is needed by a flomat procedure
(define (uniform-dummy dummy) {-1 + (random) * 2})
; return a random number between [inf, sup]
(define (uniform-interval inf sup)
  {gap <- sup - inf}
  {inf + gap * (random)})
(overload-procedure uniform uniform-dummy (number?))
(overload-procedure uniform uniform-interval (number? number?))
}|

@defform[(define-overload-existing-procedure name)]{Define an overloaded existing procedure named @racket[name].}

(overload-existing-procedure length string-length (string?))

(length #(1 2 3 4))
4

(length '(1 2 3))
3

(length "abcde")
5
}|

Note that when no defined predicates matches the arguments, in the above example nor @racket[vector?] nor @racket[string?] will return true for a @racket[list] then the overloading schema fall back to the original procedure definition that is here @racket[length] that works with @racket[list].



@defform[(define-overload-operator name)]{Define an overloaded operator named @racket[name].}

@defform[(overload-operator name special (predicate ...))]{Overload an operator named @racket[name] with a specialized operator named @racket[special] which use parameters that pass the @racket[predicates] test.}

@codeblock|{
(overload-existing-operator + vector-append (vector? vector?))

Now the @racket[+] append vectors like in Python language:

@codeblock|{
{#(1 2 3) + #(4 5 6 7)}
'#(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

{(vector 1 2 3) + (vector 4 5 6 7)}
'#(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

;; create an array with 1 in front for the bias coefficient
{z_1 <- #(1) + z[i]} ; + operator has been overloaded to append scheme vectors
}|

Example for accessing and modifying a line of a matrix:

@codeblock|{
(struct matrix-vect (v)) ;; matrix based on vector of vectors

(define (matrix-vect-line-ref M lin)
  {v <- (matrix-vect-v M)}

@section[#:tag "makefile"]{Using Makefile and debugging Scheme+ program}


The Racket GUI can not display the line of error in a Scheme+ program.The reason is because the Scheme+ program is pre-parsed by the SRFI 105 reader and the Racket compiler has not access to the original lines of code and even do not display the error line relative to the resulting parsed line of code.

If you have to debug your source code you must generate a Scheme file
from your Scheme+ file with @bold{curly-infix2prefix4racket} in SRFI 105 package and load the
result file in Racket GUI. Then you will have all the debug
information of Racket on the scheme file.

Another solution is to simply copy/paste the pure Racket
code generated by the SRFI 105 Curly Infix parser and run it like a normal Racket program.
Again you will have all the information about errors with the true line number displayed.

Another method is to use the Makefile provided:

@url["https://github.com/damien-mattei/Scheme-PLUS-for-Racket/blob/main/examples/racket/Makefile"]

Put the Makefile in the same place of your Scheme+ program and type in the terminal @bold{make}.
The Makefile will parse all Scheme+ program in the same directory and generate the scheme version in @bold{MODULE_DIRECTORY=parsed_files_directory}.You can then just load and run the parsed files in Racket GUI to use all the Racket features and tools (macro stepper,etc) for debugging.
