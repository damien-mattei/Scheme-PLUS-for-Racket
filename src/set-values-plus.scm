;; this version can set values for arrays,hash tables,etc
;; it uses the Scheme+ assignment operator: <-
(define-syntax set!-values-plus
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ (var var* ...) exp)
     (call-with-values
       (lambda () exp)
       (lambda (value . rest)
         (<- var value) ;; instead of set! i use the Scheme+ assignment operator
         (set!-values-plus (var* ...) (apply values rest)))))
    ((_ () exp)
     (call-with-values
       (lambda () exp)
       (lambda () (values)))))) ; nothing to do!

;; (define x)
;; (define y)
;; (define z)
;; (set!-values (x y z) (values 0 1 2))
;; (pk x y z)
