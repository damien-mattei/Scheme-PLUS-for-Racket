;; The quoted lists and the pragmas CARE-OF-QUOTES-ON / CARE-OF-QUOTES-OFF
;;
;; CARE-OF-QUOTES-ON (the state at the beginning of each file) : the quotes are respected, a quoted list is data ;
;; in a quoted { } only the top level is infix, its ( ) stay data (as in SRFI 105) , see infix-top-level-only.
;;
;; CARE-OF-QUOTES-OFF : a region for the symbolic computation , the quoted and quasiquoted lists are infix expressions
;; at all levels : '(x + y * z) is '(+ x (* y z)) , `(,a · x ⊕ y) is `(⊕ (· ,a x) y) ; the parts ,... and ,@... are code
;; and are not converted (only their own quoted lists are , as all the code of the region).
;;
;; A pragma acts on the elements that follow it in the same list (the body of the module, of a procedure, ...) and on
;; all that is nested in them, until the other pragma or the end of the list ; after the end of the list the state of
;; before comes back. Written at the top level of the file, before the module form, it acts on the whole module.
;; The pragmas are removed from the code.
