# Scheme-PLUS-for-Racket
Scheme+ for DrRacket by Damien Mattei.

The documentation is here:
https://github.com/damien-mattei/Scheme-PLUS-for-Racket/blob/gh-pages/README.md


The Racket GUI can not display the line of error in a Scheme+ program.
If you have to debug your source code you must generate a Scheme file
from your Scheme+ file with curly-infix2prefix4racket and load the
result file in Racket GUI. Then you will have all the debug
information of Racket on the scheme file.
