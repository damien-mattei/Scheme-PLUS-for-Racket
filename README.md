![Scheme+ schema](schema-scheme+.jpg "Scheme+ schema")


With Racket you do not need to define/declare a variable with the
Scheme+ operator <+. Because the binding of the variable is autodetect
you can simply set the variable with <- (or :=) and Scheme+ will do the job.


The Racket GUI can not display the line of error in a Scheme+ program.
If you have to debug your source code you must generate a Scheme file
from your Scheme+ file with curly-infix2prefix4racket and load the
result file in Racket GUI. Then you will have all the debug
information of Racket on the scheme file.Another solution is to simply copy/paste the pure Racket
code generated by the SRFI 105 Curly Infix parser and run it like a normal Racket program.
Again you will have all the information about errors with the true line number displayed.
