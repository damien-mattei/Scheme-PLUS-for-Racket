	;; known-program? is kept a plain procedure, on purpose, NOT a macro.
	;;
	;; A macro would not help: (known-program? gag), with gag a bare, unquoted identifier
	;; that is nowhere bound, can never work inside a *compiled* program (a Racket module,
	;; or any compiled Scheme) -- macro or procedure makes no difference. A compiled module
	;; must statically resolve, at compile time, every identifier it references as an
	;; expression; an identifier bound nowhere is a *compile-time* error ("gag: unbound
	;; identifier"), which aborts compiling the whole module before any code -- including
	;; a macro-expanded defatalize/with-handlers -- ever runs. Substituting gag into a macro
	;; template changes nothing: it is still the very same unbound identifier, still resolved
	;; statically by the compiler at the call site.
	;; This only "works" (gracefully returning #f instead of failing to compile) at the
	;; interactive REPL/top-level, which specifically defers unbound-*variable* checks to
	;; runtime -- a property of the REPL, unrelated to macro vs procedure, and irrelevant to
	;; compiled code. Since every real caller in this codebase already passes a quoted symbol
	;; or a bound variable holding a datum (see quote-known-program?,
	;; more-generic-known-program?, generic-known-program? in infix-prefix-postfix.rkt),
	;; never a bare unquoted identifier, this limitation is never actually hit in practice.

	;; -------------------------------------------------------
	;; Both macros are identical except for their single-argument fallback clause
	;; (the (kwot-or-syntax var1) clause, shared below, behaves the same in both):
	;;   generic-known-program?      : (known-program? var1)           -- evaluates var1
	;;   more-generic-known-program? : (known-program? (quote var1))   -- quotes var1
	;; That difference matters only for a BARE argument (neither 'quoted nor #'syntax) and
	;; gives genuinely different results depending on what that argument is:
	;;
	;; * var1 is a variable holding a value (the normal case: testing what a variable
	;;   contains, e.g. a token grabbed while parsing, as infix-prefix-postfix.rkt does) :
	;;   use generic-known-program?, which evaluates var1 to get at that value.
	;;     (define f 'and)
	;;     (generic-known-program? f)      -> 'macro  (correctly tests the SYMBOL f holds)
	;;     (more-generic-known-program? f) -> #f       (wrong here: quotes the identifier f
	;;                                                   itself, i.e. tests the literal
	;;                                                   symbol 'f, ignoring what f holds)
	;;
	;; * var1 is a syntactic keyword written directly at the call site (and, or, ...) :
	;;   use more-generic-known-program?, since evaluating a syntactic keyword as an
	;;   expression is a *compile-time* error -- quoting it first avoids that.
	;;     (generic-known-program? and)      -> does not even compile: "and: bad syntax"
	;;     (more-generic-known-program? and) -> 'macro
	;;
	;; * var1 is already a global, always-bound identifier (+, -, ...), or the argument is
	;;   already wrapped in 'quote/#'syntax : both macros agree (evaluating a global gives
	;;   its value directly ; the (kwot-or-syntax var1) clause is shared).
	;;     (generic-known-program? +)      -> #t
	;;     (more-generic-known-program? +) -> #t
