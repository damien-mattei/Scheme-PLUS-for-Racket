;; FR : nouveau cœur de précédence infixe pour Scheme+, un parseur de Pratt (binding power + nud/led par
;;      token, une seule boucle recursive), qui remplace !*-generic-infix-parser/!**-generic-infix-parser
;;      (voir infix-with-precedence-to-prefix.rkt) derriere le parametre use-pratt-parser?.
;;
;; EN : new infix precedence core for Scheme+, a Pratt parser (binding power + nud/led per token, a
;;      single recursive loop), replacing !*-generic-infix-parser/!**-generic-infix-parser (see
;;      infix-with-precedence-to-prefix.rkt) behind the use-pratt-parser? parameter.
;;
;; scope (see the migration plan) : unary +/- and chained in/equalities are reimplemented here as a
;; nud and a led, cleanly subsuming plus-minus-parser.rkt / in-equalities.rkt's algorithms -- but as of
;; this change the 4 live entry points of infix-with-precedence-to-prefix.rkt still call those two FSMs
;; in their pre-processing BEFORE reaching this core (unchanged, per the plan), so a raw unary sign or a
;; raw chained in/equality never actually reaches pratt-infix-parser through the live pipeline today ;
;; nud-unary-sign and led-relational are correct and unit-tested directly, but not yet wired end-to-end.
;; Postfix operators and the runtime-deferred dispatch of unknown/overloaded operators stay entirely
;; outside this core too, handled exactly as before by infix-prefix-postfix.rkt and the report mechanism
;; in infix-with-precedence-to-prefix.rkt.

  ;; {3 mult 5}) that a creator like (lambda (op a b) (op a b)) must be able to call directly -- replacing
